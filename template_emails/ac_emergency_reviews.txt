Subject: [EMNLP Industry Track] Emergency Reviews due in 48 hours


Dear {{fullname}},

Thank you for your hard work in assigning emergency reviewers over the past few days. If you have three reviews for all the papers in your area, congratulations!

We still need about 90 reviews (9% of the total) across all areas.

The rebuttal period will begin on September 5 at the end of the day (AoE), so itâ€™s important that emergency reviews are completed by then. From now on, emergency reviewers will have 48 hours to finish their reviews.

If you have any papers with fewer than three reviews, please ensure that the assigned emergency reviewers are on track and aware of the upcoming rebuttal and the 48-hour deadline.

If an emergency reviewer does not respond, please assign another one and inform them of the 48-hour deadline for submitting their review.

We appreciate your assistance in securing the final reviews.


Best regards,
Anastasia, Daniel, Franck
