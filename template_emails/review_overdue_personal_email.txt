Dear [Recipient's Name],

You were assigned 4 papers to review for the EMNLP 2024 Industry Track, but we currently have not received any reviews from you.

Could you please let us know if you will be able to submit the outstanding reviews? The author-reviewer discussion period begins on September 5, and we would like to have all reviews completed by then.

Thank you in advance for your response!

Best regards,
Franck, Daniel, Anastasia
