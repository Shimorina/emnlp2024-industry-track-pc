[EMNLP Industry Track] Reminder: Request to Complete Exit Survey

Dear {{fullname}},

This is a gentle reminder to complete the exit survey for the EMNLP Industry Track.

If you have already submitted your feedback, thank you! If not, please log in to your author console at [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/) to rate the reviews your submission received. Your feedback is essential for improving our review process.

Please remember that the quality of the review is not determined by the score assigned to your submission. A review may have a low score yet provide detailed, actionable feedback. We encourage you to assess the review text independently of the scores.

To complete the survey, please visit the submission page, and for each review, click the "Author Review Rating" button. Each review can receive only one rating, so please discuss and reach a consensus within your author team. The survey will be open until 30 September, 2024, 23:59 AoE.

Thank you for your participation!

Best regards,

EMNLP 2024 Industry Track PC Chairs
